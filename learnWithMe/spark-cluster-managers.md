# Spark Cluster Managers

Cluster managers are responsible for resource allocation and scheduling in a Spark cluster. Choosing the right manager depends on your infrastructure, scalability needs, and integration requirements.

## Comparison Table

| Cluster Manager   | Pros                                      | Cons                                         | When to Use                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Standalone**   | Easy setup, built-in, good for small jobs  | Limited features, less robust for large scale| Simple clusters, dev/test, small jobs |
| **YARN**         | Integrates with Hadoop, multi-tenant, mature| Complex setup, Hadoop dependency             | Hadoop environments, enterprise   |
| **Mesos**        | Fine-grained sharing, supports many frameworks| Complex, less Spark-specific support         | Multi-framework clusters          |
| **Kubernetes**   | Cloud-native, container orchestration, scalable| Newer, more config needed, networking issues | Cloud, containerized workloads    |

## Summary

- **Standalone**: Use for quick setups, dev/test, or small production clusters.
- **YARN**: Best for Hadoop shops and large, multi-tenant clusters.
- **Mesos**: Good for sharing resources across many distributed apps.
- **Kubernetes**: Ideal for cloud, containerized, and scalable deployments.
