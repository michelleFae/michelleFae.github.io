# How Spark Works

Spark is a powerful distributed computing engine designed for big data processing and analytics. It provides an easy-to-use API for large-scale data processing and supports multiple languages, including Python, Scala, and Java.

## Key Concepts

1. **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)**
   - The core abstraction in Spark. RDDs are fault-tolerant collections of data that can be operated on in parallel.

2. **Transformations and Actions**
   - Transformations (like `map`, `filter`) build up a computation plan, but are not executed until an action (like `collect`, `count`) is called.

3. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**
   - Spark builds a DAG of stages and tasks to optimize execution.

4. **Lazy Evaluation**
   - Computations are only triggered when an action is called, allowing Spark to optimize the plan.

5. **In-Memory Computing**
   - Spark keeps data in memory for fast, iterative processing, making it much faster than traditional disk-based engines like Hadoop MapReduce.

## Spark Architecture

- **Driver Program**: Coordinates the execution of tasks.
- **Cluster Manager**: Allocates resources (e.g., YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes, or Spark's standalone cluster manager).
- **Executors**: Run tasks and store data.

## Typical Workflow

1. Load data from storage (HDFS, S3, etc.)
2. Define transformations (e.g., filter, map)
3. Trigger actions (e.g., collect, save)
4. Spark schedules and executes tasks across the cluster

Spark is widely used for ETL, machine learning, and real-time analytics at scale.
