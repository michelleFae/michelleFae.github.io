                <p>Hi I’m Jacqueline! Along with Brandon and Chirasree, I am a publicity officer. The publicity committee - or pubs for short - makes sure that all UPE's events are well advertised. We create amazing designs for UPE merch and also handle UPE's newsletter and social media accounts.</p>
                <p>Before we begin - here's a quick tip: CLICK (don't just hover over) a whale if you'd like to see what they're saying. Use the navbar, arrow keys, or your mouse to move around.</p>
                <p>For this task, take a picture of everyone in your team (via zoom is fine). In the picture, everyone should be wearing or holding at least one blue item! It doesn't need to be the same blue item.</p>
                <p>You could be wearing a blue cap or holding a blue mug - as long as it's clearly visible in the picture, the photo will be a valid submission.</p>

                <p>For this task, EVERYONE on the team should submit the form. However, only one team member needs to upload the picture.</p> 
                <p>In addition to filling in the form, ONE person should upload the picture on the #candidates channel in the UPE slack.</p>

                <p>Whale hello! My name is Prakash! I am an Industrial Relations (Indrel) officer - just like Stella, Brian, and Jason are. Indrel fortifies UPE's bond with companies through organizing company events and collecting funding.</p>
                <p>Indrel planned to send a company an email with only commas. However, we think we mistyped and added in one fullstop in the email by mistake. Can you help spot the index of the fullstop? <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZHSj6MYFeDc_2ORBGcf_kd30ly3Gk8RHNvNzwcERa1A/edit?usp=sharing">Here is the doc with our email.</a></p>

      </div>
     <div id="fullstop-whale-1" class="generalDialogue" style="display:none">
            <div class="text left-align">
                <p>Here's a quick suggestion - code up a small program to help locate the fullstop - it might just be better than manual counting! Don't count spaces in your index count.</a>.</p>
                
                <p>Once you do get the index number, how do you get the secret character at position 1? Take the index number mod 100. From this new number, subtract 6. Then look up the decimal value of the corresponding character in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters#Basic_Latin">this unicode table</a>. For example, if the index is 399, we take 399 mod 100, which gives us 99. Then, we subtract 6 from it, giving us 93. 93 corresponds to the character ']', which we would then record as the character in the 1st position in our final secret code.</p>
                <p>Good luck!</p>

                <p>My task for you is quite simple - name the officer that has a red car in his/her/their whale emoji on slack.</p>
                <p>The secret final word's 2nd character is the lowercase version of the 1st index character in this officer's name. For example, if the officer's name is Sajal, the 1st character in Sajal is a lowercase 'a'. So the 2nd character in the final secret word is 'a'.</p>
