                                In November 2019, I attended the Hack For Social Impact Hackathon and got the opportunity to build a complaint system for the Berkeley Free Clinic, an NPO right next to campus. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I formed a team with two other people and raced against the clock to finish the entire project in less than 48 hours. Our final product was a complaint system which recieves complaints from patients and sends out weekly reminder emails to employees that have unresolved complaints.
                                The Berkeley Free Clinic ended up choosing our project and uses the Complaint System till today!

                                I built a bat hunt game, complete with sound effects, during the Game Development Decal in Spring 2020!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The aim of the game is to get to a red gate located somewhere in the game. But - beware! If you get too close to a bat, they start following you! Red bats hurt you, causing your life to decrease! And green bats hurt you even more! Regain your health by finding chests throughout the game. But - once again - beware! Whilst some chests contain potions that heal you, others contain potions that harm you! So, choose wisely.

                                I was elected as a Professional Development Officer for Upsilon Pi Epsilon in Spring 2020. I created a quick-reference advice page <a class= "blueLink" href="https://upe-profdev.gitlab.io/advice/" title="UPE Interview Bank">(https://upe-profdev.gitlab.io/advice/)</a> to help students with interviews. The page acts as a quick guide for basic interview tips and is purposefully made succinct in order to help students optimize time in their busy schedules.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also collaborated with another UPE officer to build the online UPE interview bank. I also made video tutorials for the same.

                            <p>
                                We also re-vamped the student services section on the main UPE website <a class= "blueLink" href="https://upe.berkeley.edu/" title="UPE website">(https://upe.berkeley.edu/)</a> ~ making it easier to navigate through. I also introduced a new system of phone interviews, which we included in the re-vamped student services section.
